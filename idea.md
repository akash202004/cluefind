🧩 Core Idea

Users upload their resume (PDF) + GitHub username.
The system:

Extracts data from the resume (skills, experience, projects).

Fetches data from GitHub API (top repos, languages, stars).

Uses GPT to write a polished bio, skill summary, and project descriptions.

Builds a public, shareable page (e.g. /u/akash) with that data.

Others can “Star” that profile (like appreciation points).

A Leaderboard ranks developers based on stars.

⚙️ Flow Overview
🧭 Step 1: User Setup

User logs in using GitHub OAuth (NextAuth).

Uploads a resume (PDF).

The backend:

Extracts text using pdf-parse or LangChain DocumentLoader.

Pulls GitHub data via REST API (/users/:username/repos).

Combines both → sends to OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for analysis.

🧠 Step 2: AI Processing

Prompt example:

Analyze the following resume and GitHub repos. 
Summarize the person’s top 3 projects, skill areas, and technical strengths.
Return a short bio, skills section, and project highlights in JSON.


Output example:

{
  "bio": "Akash is a full-stack developer specializing in scalable MERN & Go systems.",
  "skills": ["React", "Next.js", "Go", "PostgreSQL", "Docker"],
  "projects": [
    { "name": "Mutual Fund Tracker", "desc": "Real-time analytics dashboard using Next.js + Go." },
    { "name": "DevSync", "desc": "SaaS for developer portfolio and blogs." }
  ]
}

🖥️ Step 3: Portfolio Generation

Creates a public route like /u/[username].

Uses ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) to:

Cache the portfolio for fast access.

Regenerate every X minutes for GitHub updates.

Use dynamic imports (lazy loading) for components like charts or code snippets.

🌟 Step 4: Stars & Leaderboard

Each profile has a "Star this developer" button.

Click → sends request to API /api/star/[userId]

Increments star count in PostgreSQL + Redis cache.

Uses IP/device-based rate limiting (via upstash/ratelimit).

/leaderboard shows devs sorted by stars (with caching).

🧠 Next.js Features to Use
Feature	Implementation
ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)	Each portfolio page uses revalidate: 3600 to auto-update from GitHub hourly.
Code Splitting	Lazy load sections (e.g. project cards, analytics widgets).
Caching	Redis cache for star counts + leaderboard.
Server Actions	For star increment logic — atomic and secure.
Dynamic Routes	/u/[username] for profiles, /leaderboard for rankings.
Edge Functions	For AI prompt + GitHub API fetch (low latency).
🎮 Gamification Details
Feature	Description
⭐ Stars System	Each user can be starred once per visitor/IP.
🏆 Leaderboard	Displays top developers ranked by stars.
🔥 Trends Section	“Most Starred This Week” using time-based queries.
🧩 Badge System (Optional)	AI assigns badges like “Top Backend Dev”, “Clean Code Expert”, etc.
🔒 Security & Performance

Input sanitization with Zod.

API rate limiting for stars.

OAuth2 (GitHub) for authentication.

Prisma schema validation.

ISR + caching = blazing fast profiles.

🚀 How You’d Implement It (Step-by-Step Plan)

Setup Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind + Prisma

Auth (NextAuth with GitHub)

Upload Resume & GitHub username → API for AI Analysis

Generate public portfolio page with ISR

Add star system API (with Redis caching)

Add leaderboard page

Polish UI with Framer Motion & Tailwind

Deploy to Vercel + connect PostgreSQL (Neon/Supabase)
