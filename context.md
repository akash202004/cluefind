Fullstack Developer Fulltime Assignment 1
We are seeking highly skilled and motivated individuals proficient
in modern web development. Candidates must be good with Node.js,
capable of building efficient, scalable, and secure backend
solutions, including asynchronous programming, RESTful APIs,
database integration (SQL/NoSQL), middleware, and package
management.
Expertise in Next.js is crucial, encompassing server-side rendering
(SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, optimization,
routing, data fetching, and deployment.
A strong understanding of basic React.js development is essential,
covering component-based architecture, state management (Hooks,
Context API, Query Params), lifecycle methods, and the virtual DOM.
Overall, candidates should possess a comprehensive understanding of
full-stack development, from concept to deployment. This includes
building robust, scalable, fast, secure, and user-friendly
applications while adhering to best practices for code quality and
maintainability. Experience with AI technologies is a significant
plus.
What do we expect from you?
We don't expect a basic CRUD application. We want you to showcase
your intellect and approach to developing impactful applications,
demonstrating sophisticated problem-solving and innovative solutions
beyond just technical proficiency. Your project should reflect
critical thinking, analytical capabilities, and strategic design for
valuable, transformative outcomes, from ideation to scalable
implementation.
Mandatory Skills:
Next JS, React.js, Git, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL/MongoDB
Optional Skills:
Hands-on Experience with AI libraries like AI-SDK, OpenAI, Gemini or
Groq!
Task:
Develop a full-stack, secure, and user-friendly CRUD application
using Next.js 15 that effectively addresses the requirements of a
particular user group or scenario.
Key Requirements:
Technology Stack:
● Backend/Frontend: Next.js 15 (leveraging TypeScript for type
safety and code maintainability).
● Database: Select a database management system based on project
needs (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB).
● CRUD Functionality: Create, Read, Update, and Delete
operations for data entities relevant to the chosen user
group/scenario. Ensure robust data validation and sanitization
to prevent security vulnerabilities.
● User Interface: Design a clean, intuitive, and responsive user
interface that aligns with Next.js 15's component-based
architecture and styling capabilities. You can use Tailwind
CSS and RadixUI for designings elements. Consider
accessibility best practices to cater to users with diverse
needs.
● Deployment: Deploy the application to a suitable hosting
platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify). Configure continuous
integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) for streamlined
development and deployment processes.
● Code Optimization: Optimize code for performance and
efficiency, considering techniques like code splitting,
caching, and server-side rendering (SSR). Write clean,
well-structured, and well-documented code that adheres to best
practices and style guides .
● Real-World Considerations: Address potential real-world
challenges that might arise in a production environment, such
as scalability, error handling, and security.
● Use AI for add-on features (Optional): Leverage AI for a wide
array of add-on features. AI is a game-changer,
revolutionizing various industries and aspects of daily life.
Its integration allows for enhanced capabilities, providing a
significant competitive edge and opening up new possibilities
for innovation and efficiency.
Good to Have:
● Authentication and Authorization: Implement a secure
authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT-based or other preferred
approach). Enforce granular authorization rules to control
user access to resources and actions
● Testing: Consider integration and end-to-end testing for
comprehensive coverage.
● Security: Discuss mitigation strategies and contingency plans
for these challenges.
Evaluation Criteria:
● Functionality: Completeness and correctness of CRUD
operations, data validation, authentication, and
authorization.
● User Interface: User-friendliness, responsiveness, and
adherence to accessibility best practices.
● Code Quality: Code structure, organization, documentation, and
optimization techniques.
● Testing: Coverage and effectiveness of unit, integration, and
end-to-end tests.
● Deployment: Successful deployment and CI/CD configuration. ●
Real-World Considerations: Demonstrated understanding of
potential challenges and proposed solutions.
Submission Guidelines:
